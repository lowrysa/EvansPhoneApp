An app for my friend Evan :)
Built so he can listen to a new album on his rides to work
Basically, it accesses the Spotify API to retreive album information

$ cd EvansPhoneApp
$ npx react-native start
(Then press which option for simulator)

To install on iPhone:
Open project in XCode by selecting the .workspace file (inside of ios folder)
